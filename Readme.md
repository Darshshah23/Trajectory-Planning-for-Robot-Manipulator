## Introduction

The main aim of this project is to follow the trajectory planning of 2 DOF robotics manipulators in a given environment. Inverse kinematics is used by giving initial and final locations which are required for trajectory planning.

we develop and execute the trajectory of the letters "MAE 547." The trajectory will be planned based on the coordinates provided, and the robot (planar2) will carry it out.

## Approach

For trajectory of the “MAE547”, we have planned the coordinates in 3-dimensions as shown in picture and defined points for robot to follow. We have performed the inverse kinematics for the coordinates and the results are performed by the 2-planar robot. For smooth transition, we have divided the length between two points in to 20.

For trajectory, we have picked two different approaches.

1) For “MAE”, the robot will get the direction and follow that simultaneously.

2) For “547”, the whole trajectory will be planned priorly and the Robot just have to follow accordingly.

## Result

Result shows the smooth transition of the Planar2 robot on the created trajectory and even between two words. The video link of the full implementation is attached and the code is explained as well.
