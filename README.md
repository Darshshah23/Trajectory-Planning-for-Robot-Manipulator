# Trajectory-Planning-for-Robot-Manipulator

The main aim of this project is to follow the trajectory planning of 2 DOF robotics manipulators in a given environment. Inverse kinematics is used by giving initial and final locations which are required for trajectory planning.

we develop and execute the trajectory of the letters "MAE 547." The trajectory will be planned based on the coordinates provided, and the robot (planar2) will carry it out.
